Task Details and Approach <br>
<br>
Task 1: Red Wine Regression Rally <br>
The objective is to perform data analysis on a wine dataset to understand the factors affecting wine quality. <br>
The libraries used were pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.<br>
Our approach is to first load and explore the dataset to understand the data structure and types.<br>
Conducted data cleaning and handling missing values or removing duplicate rows.<br>
Created graphs to analyse and visualize the trends in chemical properties and compare them. <br>
Performed statistical analysis, eg.calculate mean, max, and min values of properties to understand their ranges and typical values.<br>
Appliying conditions to filter the data on specific properties to get highest quality wine.<br>
<br>
Task 2: CubeSAT Conquest
Objective: Design a CubeSAT for studying Venus's atmosphere.<br>
Subsystems: Communication, Sensor, Power, and Mechanical.<br>
Approach:<br>
Researched components needed for a CubeSAT capable of atmospheric study.<br>
Designed subsystems to fit within the size and weight limitations.<br>
Visualized the CubeSAT structure and each subsystemâ€™s role, focusing on power systems, communication, and data transmission back to Earth.<br>
<br>
Task 3: Astral Imagination <br>
Objective: Generate an AI-driven image of a space phenomenon (e.g., supernova, black hole).<br>
Tools: Used a generative AI tool for image creation.<br>
Approach:
Create a detailed prompt to instruct the AI to create an image representing a specific cosmic event.<br>
Focused on giving details for colors, lighting, and specific features to make it look as realistic as possible.
